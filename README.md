# Image-Classifier

##Description
This project involves classifying images from the CIFAR dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes, each with 6,000 images. The objective is to predict the correct class for a given image.

##Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following classes:

1.Airplane
2.Automobile
3.Bird
4.Cat
5.Deer
6.Dog
7.Frog
8.Horse
9.Ship
10.Truck
Each class contains 6,000 images, with a total of 60,000 images in the dataset. The images are 32x32 pixels in size and are in color.

##Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify images into one of the 10 classes mentioned above.
